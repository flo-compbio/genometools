    Annotation sources and redundant gene annotations
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    According to the Ensembl website (1), the Ensembl gene annotation
    GTF files for human, mouse, zebrafish, rat and pig essentially
    contain two sets of annotations:
    
    One set consists of all annotations with the "ensembl"
    source annotation (column 2). These annotations are the product of
    the automated Ensembl "genebuild" pipeline.
    
    The other set consists of genes that are manually annotated by
    the HAVANA team (source "havana"), some of which have been merged with the
    automatic annotations (source "ensembl_havana").
    
    There seems to be no overlap between genes annotated with "havana" and
    "ensembl_havana" sources, respectively. However, there are a few genes for
    which only annotations with source "ensembl" exist.
    
    Our policy is therefore to prefer annotations with source "ensembl_havana"
    and "havana" over those with source "ensembl", and to only keep annotations
    with source "ensembl" if there are no manually curated alternative
    annotations.
    
    A special case is represented by mitochondrial genes, which always have the
    source "insdc".
    
    (1) see http://www.ensembl.org/Help/Faq?id=152


    Removal of duplicates
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    Unfortunately, the Ensembl gene annotations contain duplicates for a
    handful of genes. For example, for MATR3, there are ENSG00000015479 and
    ENSG00000280987, both of type
    "ensembl_havana". There seems to be no clear criterion by which we could
    rationally and automatically choose one ID over the other, at least based
    on information contained
    in the GTF file.
    
    We therefore remove duplicates according to following policy:
    - For genes on '+' strand, keep the gene with the left-most starting
      position.
    - For genes on '-' strand, keep the gene with the right-most starting
      position.
    (In case the starting positions are equal, we keep the one that occurs
    first in the GTF file.)
    
    We would like to use the pandas.DataFrame.drop_duplicates() function for
    this. So we're temporarily reordering genes using their signed position,
    and then we're using the original index (position) to restore the original
    order.
